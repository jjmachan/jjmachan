Currently I'm working with the awesome team [@bentoml](https://github.com/bentoml) to build tool that help Data Scientits/ML Engineers with model packaging, deployment and orchestration. BentoML is an open platform that simplifies ML model deployment and enables you to serve your models at production scale in minutes. I'm helping build [bentoml/bentoctl](https://github.com/bentoml/bentoctl) which makes it really fast to deploy ML model to the cloud.

In my free time I work on [Broke Maintainer](https://brokemaintainer.substack.com/) which is a newsletter about my thoughts, ideas and experiments in the realm of open source and building open source businesses. This has been an intersection that I’m super curious about and I try to share my experiences in this space. We have a few programs like:

  1. **Coffee with Maintainer** sessions where we talk with other maintainers of popular open-source projects and learn about their stories.
  2. **OSS Case Studies** to look into open-source companies and see how they operate and how they were able to leverage the project and community and build a business around it.
  3. My own **Personal Experiments**, open-source projects and the lessons I learn from them.
